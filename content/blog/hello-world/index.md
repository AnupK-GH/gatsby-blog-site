# Welcome!

This is my first post on my new blog!

Over the past few years, I have developed an interest to learn about cloud computing. Last year over the summer, I decided to get serious and started to take Microsoft Virtual Training Days courses. The first two courses I took were Azure Fundamentals and AI Fundamentals. After taking those two courses, I knew this was the path I wanted to pursue. Just before Halloween 2021, I created my own timeline of certifications I wanted to obtain and went about studying for them. 

The intent of my blog is to share with you my cloud journey. So join me on my cloud journey where I share what I’m learning, what projects I’m working on, and if I am working on any certifications.
